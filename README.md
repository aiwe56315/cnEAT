This is a Qualtrics version of the Empathic Accuracy Task with codes adapted from Dr. Desmond Ong at the University of Texas at Austin. 

The task involves pulling a video from an online repository (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox) via its URL, and presenting the video on the Qualtrics survey page. Underneath the video, a slider will be presented for participants to continuously rate the emotional intensity of the narrator in the video while watching the video.
